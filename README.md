# Real-Time Face Detection

This project demonstrates a simple real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Python. It captures video from the webcam and detects faces using a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier. The system displays whether a face is detected or not in the webcam feed.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using the webcam.
- Displays "Face Detected" when a face is detected and "No Face Detected" when not.
- User-friendly with webcam input for face recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Numpy
- PyYAML

You can install all the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
